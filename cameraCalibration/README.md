# Pose Estimation and Camera Calibration
In this package, we mainly implement the **Camera Calibration** algorithm for both hand-handle camera and the monocular camera equipped on a real Quadrotor.

Hand-handled Camera Calibration
-------------------------------
We aim to estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic matrices for a hand-handled camera, which is also called as _camera calibration_.

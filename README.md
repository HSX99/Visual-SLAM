# Visual_SLAM
Visual SLAM and 3D map building as well as robot trajectory estimation | GRASP research project

# Strcuture from Motion
The package implements feature matching and visual optimization algorithms such as linear and nonliear triangulation, PnP and bundle adjustment,
to verify the fesibility and accuracy of the visual slam algorithm when the feature detection is good. The package plays an important role for
visual slam package.

# Visual SLAM 3D
The package implements visual slam using the monocular camera, and built a 3D feature point-cloud map as well as representing the walking robot trajectory.
